***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, practicing an unknown law, and provide the following evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.


***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these statements, which some may find offensive, including myself.

GalvestonTx / GalvestonTx.co is not affiliated in anyway with the government of Galveston County‚Ä¶as it is known.

* Galvestontx.co aims to use this page to encourage other‚Äôs who have been terrorized by the county to actively replace certain functions of the county and state "governments" with distributed ledger technology.

Biden allocated $350,000,000,000 of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, meant to help Americans struggling as a result of the pandemic to be used instead for purchasing advanced weapons to be used exclusively against Americans (inside of their homes). Biden encouraged more spending on police tech, despite local activists‚Äô calls to fund life-sustaining food and housing programs.

Police Are Buying Drones and Armored Vehicles With COVID Relief Funds

> "The Kingsport Police Department, a small agency in Tennessee, purchased two ‚Äúmilitary-grade‚Äù drones in early March. And Dixon County City Council in California is considering using ARPA funds on a police drone program, body-worn cameras, and a license plate reader program."  

How much tax dollars did the county waste with their fraudulent emergency response mentioned in the attached document? More importantly, what is the radical ideology driving their actions... that is a discussion for another time (hint: name of PAC which provided campaign contributions to the persons responsible for terrorizing tens of thousands each year).

Upon uploading the remaining eight files, I hope to begin development of a DApp to supplant the county and state governments, and invite everyone to join.

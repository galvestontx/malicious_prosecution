***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, that practice an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6vn3HHm6z-dXNBUNmM8QrHjJHQ0nHx1/view?usp=drivesdk) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these [statements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6vn3HHm6z-dXNBUNmM8QrHjJHQ0nHx1/view?usp=drivesdk), which some may find offensive...myself included. I decided to make information public to prevent the same from happening to other's. So long as no one knows what is taking place at Galveston County and elsewhere, and the public rely solely on the falsified information published in court records, nothing will prevent these criminals from engaging in the same harmful activity.  

***File 2 of 9*** is used to supplement ***File 1 of 9***. All evidence is provided in the file - including the police statements, which are attached as Exhibit 3-6 in ***File 1 of 9***, and the [audio](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/cee3feb0e13e67209791023ee602ef2bd3e9ee39/First_Call.m4a) for the Emergency Call Transcription (Exhibit-A transcription) now available for download. ***File 2 of 9***, also includes evidence the court already convicted Alghuti of a crime prior to the first setting scheduled on May 6, 2022. This is a result of deliberately intermingling the civil case with the criminal charges.

### HISTORY OF GALVESTON COUNTY | MALICIOUS PROSECUTION 
##
A fifteen-month investigation of Galveston County revealed that thousands of people are locked away each year, without a hearing, simply because they cannot afford to pay money bail. The practice perpetuates a two-tiered and unconstitutional wealth-based incarceration system that devastates individuals, their families and their communities. Those who cannot afford bail must remain in jail for considerable periods of time, leading many to lose their jobs, their homes, and their children. As a result, defendants often plead guilty to the crimes of which they are charged, not because they are guilty, but because it‚Äôs the fastest way out of jail, and they are desperate to return to their communities.
[see lawsuit](https://www.aclutx.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/pi_motion._booth.pdf)


***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense.  These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 

> According to Galveston County District Attorney‚Äôs official website, Jack Roady ‚Äúserves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County‚Äù.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney)

> The official website further states ‚ÄúThe primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done‚Äù. Let's take a look at Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney/district-attorney-s-office)

We now have individuals running the state that are convinced it is alright to interfere in the private affairs of a family, by framing one party with a crime in order to strip the person of any right and enforce an illegal eviction. Im certain these people will be punished according to their involvement. Such justice is not possible in Texas court's...made clear by this case. The false testimony submitted by persons named in the above [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk) is of little concern (as it is expected), my primary concern is the government response.

### Upcoming Online Petitions & Event Log
##
***Note:*** no action stated in below petitions will replace the irrevocable demands and terms set by Alghuti (will be published in file 9 of 9). If it is found that the conduct of attorney‚Äôs, judges, officers, and other officials (elected by interests) involved in this case are considered "legal", it is evidence of an illegitimate legal system, and it is a duty to abolish it entirely.  

* Petition for the Annexation of Area 1, 3, 4 into the COUNTY OF LEAGUED CITIES 
* Petition for the immediate removal of Kerri Foley and all judges involved in this case from the bench, and to bar named judges from any public office or position of trust. The procedure used in this case, as well as actions taken by attorney‚Äôs, judges, other officers involved has discredited the judiciary or the administration of justice. This [Commission](http://www.scjc.texas.gov/faq/) has been aware of these practices, and has done nothing. 

* Demand the Harris Administration identity who the victim is in this case, in reference to the [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), Which states - <i>"For too long, domestic violence was considered a ‚Äúfamily issue‚Äù and was left for families to address in private."</i> <strong><i>"many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family"</i></strong>.. ü§î sounds about right. 
***Note*** to achieve the 100,000 signature required to get this to the Whitehouse, a video will be produced for conveying to the general public. 

* Recently Twitter blocked me from the account established for this page before I had the chance to make a single post. If the FTC fails to enforce antitrust policy within 90 days, a call for protest and demand for the immediate seizure all the company assets will be published. In the mean time im looking into viable alternatives such as Vkontakte or odnoklassniki. It is sad that we now have to rely on foreign social media platforms to communicate. That's the United State's of America in the year 2022, with "freedom of the press" as the only profession explicitly mentioned in the constitution by name. Not to worry, we are in good hands, the Harris Administration established ["A government agency creating a ‚Äúministry of truth‚Äù to combat what it deems misinformation? And it‚Äôs going to fall under the leadership of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas? What could possibly go wrong?"](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3472878-joe-bidens-ministry-of-truth/)

> ***Additional Information***:
> Hatem Al-Ghuti pledges to convey title to approximately 10,256 square feet (~.2355 acres) of land in League City to the County of Leagued Cities. The title to property had been transferred into a private trust on August 11, 2020 at 5:56 PM for the purpose of securing Alghuti's property from hostile entities. The code securing the title to the property is self executing, thus removing it from Alghuti's direct management. This code will be published after ***File 9 of 9*** is uploaded. The County of Leagued Cities Appraisal District values the property on the land at $367,590 (in-kind exchange) - est. $146.80 per square foot.

***Early Settlement Option - Galveston County***


The Galveston County regime must be dismantled, this is not an item that will be negotiated. It is understood Galveston County will be allowed to keep some land under its governance in Precinct 2, as a token of goodwill and mercy from Alghuti- and for the public interest. To express its gratitude for the generous terms, the county will present fifteen kilograms of fine gold (~3,535.00 Gold Dinars) as a gift to Alghuti (dba: the County of Leagued Cities Trust Co) on or before May 6, 2022, and a letter of apology for the misunderstanding. Other terms and sanctions apply, it is the county's duty to understand what those terms are. No taxes will be paid to the inactive/ complicit federal and state governments.

##
Kerri Foley must pay 264,000.00 dollars to Alghuti by 5/6/22, this will not be forgiven...nothing more heinous than a corrupt judge. Due to the extreme level of corruption, the court had been denied jurisdiction - see [Response 21-FD-0102](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12caIV_4D2Ax0wowT9MGzdq-IJwmqW2ZQ/view), and Kerri knowingly signed a fraudulent decree which had been prepared by Matthew Skillern on behalf of Rawan Alnajjar.

* The criminal case, which had already been decided in a decree signed by Kerri Foley on 11/19/21, accused Alghuti of "committed violence" and "cruelty" while denying him a single hearing. Foley refused to consider Alghuti's [Jurisdiction Challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12caIV_4D2Ax0wowT9MGzdq-IJwmqW2ZQ/view), after ignoring over a dozen request's (including two in-person request's) to equalize representation due to the gross disparity in income between Rawan Alnajjar (a physician) and Hatem Alghuti (unemployed with a high school diploma). 

* Rawan Alnajjar appeared for the trial on 11/15/21 with two attorney's present, standing on her behalf (Matthew Skillern and Ali Shah), supported by a full staff of attorney's and other legal "professionals". In the request, Alghuti clearly conveyed proof of his financial circumstances and suffering which resulted from the false accusations made by Rawan. The court refused to uphold the marital agreement signed by Rawan, which would allow for mediation (see Motion to waive Mediation), because Rawan made an accusation of violence- although proof of her false testimony was provided. Hatem Alghuti was denied all requests, not only for assistance, but also his right to due process, or even basic dignity see his daughter (they refused a request to send Alghuti a photo of his daughter). 

* To add insult to injury, Foley's illegitimate decree, demands Alghuti pay $20,000.00 to Rawan's attorney's. It is worth mentioning the common denominator between Kerri Foley and Jack Roady is that both individuals accepted campaign contributions from the ["Republican Women PAC"](https://www.transparencyusa.org/tx/payee/kerri-foley-campaign?cycle=2018-election-cycle).

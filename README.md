***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, practicing an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/f2f5154e7de2cd17b51dbdb18cacdb12124f5064/Galvestontx.co_1of9.pdf) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

### Malicious Prosecution

***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense.  These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 



> According to Galveston County District Attorney‚Äôs official website, Jack Roady ‚Äúserves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County‚Äù.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney)

> The official website further states ‚ÄúThe primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done‚Äù. Let's take a look at Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

### Upcoming Online Petitions 

According to a recent Executive Order, "For too long, domestic violence was considered a ‚Äúfamily issue‚Äù and was left for families to address in private."
After uploading document 2 of 9...which is more outrageous than the first, an online petition will demand for the Harris administration to use this case as the model for this [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), "many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family". ü§î

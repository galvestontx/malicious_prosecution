***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, practicing an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/f2f5154e7de2cd17b51dbdb18cacdb12124f5064/Galvestontx.co_1of9.pdf) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

***Notice:*** this website did not allow me to upload certain documents, its an issue we will help fix in the near future.

```

***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these statements, which some may find offensive, including myself.


This ***GalvestonTx Page*** and ***GalvestonTx.co*** website is ***NOT*** affiliated in anyway with the government of Galveston County…as it is known.

### Galvestontx.co aims to use this page to encourage other’s who have been terrorized by the county to actively replace certain functions of the county and state "governments" with distributed ledger technology.

***Upcoming Schedule***
I accepted the court's invitation to physically occupy the court on May 6, 2022. The purpose is to discuss how they intend to pay for damages. 

Im reluctant to accept USD for reason's other than the ridiculous inflation Rate. Rather, it is related to 👇 

The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds were meant to help Americans struggling as a result of the pandemic. Biden allocated $350,000,000,000 for local governments to purchase advanced weapons systems for exclusive use against the American civilian population (even inside the privacy of their homes). Biden encouraged more spending on police tech, despite local activists’ calls to fund life-sustaining food and housing programs. Perhaps "American Rescue" is used in the same manner "progressive" or "democratic" "republican" are used, none of these parties have any relation with the names they carry-- ***known*** as Astroturfing.

>##### Police Are Buying Drones and Armored Vehicles With COVID Relief Funds

> "The Kingsport Police Department, a small agency in Tennessee, purchased two “military-grade” drones in early March. And Dixon County City Council in California is considering using ARPA funds on a police drone program" and other high tech gear. 

How much tax dollars did the county waste with their fraudulent emergency response mentioned in [attached document](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/f2f5154e7de2cd17b51dbdb18cacdb12124f5064/Galvestontx.co_1of9.pdf)? More importantly, what is the radical ideology driving their actions... that is a discussion for another time (hint: name of PAC which provided campaign contributions to the persons responsible for terrorizing tens of thousands each year, see 👇 facts. Just another named "ism"... perhaps the last as it has already resulted in a schism ).

Upon uploading the remaining eight files, I hope to begin development of a DApp to supplant the county and state governments, and invite everyone to join.


# Malicious Prosecution

***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense. Hundreds if not Thousands of pages of documents will be released on this page throughout the year. These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 



> According to Galveston County District Attorney’s official website, Jack Roady “serves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County”.

> The official website further states “The primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done”. Let's take a look at Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

# Upcoming Online Petitions 

According to a recent Executive Order, "For too long, domestic violence was considered a “family issue” and was left for families to address in private."
After uploading document 2 of 9...which is more outrageous than the first. The online petition will demand for the Harris administration to use this case as the model for 👉 [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), "many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family". 🤔

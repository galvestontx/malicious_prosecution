***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, that practice an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these [statements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk), which some may find offensive. I decided to make information public to prevent the same from happening to other's. So long as no one knows what is taking place at Galveston County and elsewhere, and the public rely solely on the falsified information published in court records, nothing will prevent these criminals from engaging in the same harmful activity.

### Malicious Prosecution
##
A fifteen-month investigation of Galveston County revealed that thousands of people are locked away each year, without a hearing, simply because they cannot afford to pay money bail. The practice perpetuates a two-tiered and unconstitutional wealth-based incarceration system that devastates individuals, their families and their communities. Those who cannot afford bail must remain in jail for considerable periods of time, leading many to lose their jobs, their homes, and their children. As a result, defendants often plead guilty to the crimes of which they are charged, not because they are guilty, but because it‚Äôs the fastest way out of jail, and they are desperate to return to their communities.

***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense.  These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 

> According to Galveston County District Attorney‚Äôs official website, Jack Roady ‚Äúserves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County‚Äù.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney)

> The official website further states ‚ÄúThe primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done‚Äù. Let's take a look at Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney/district-attorney-s-office)

We now have individuals running the state that are convinced it is alright to interfere in the private affairs of a family, by framing one party with a crime in order to strip the person of any right and enforce an illegal eviction. Im certain these people will be punished according to their involvement. Such justice is not possible in Texas court's...made clear by this case. The false testimony submitted by persons named in the above [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk) is of little concern (as it is expected), my primary concern is the government response.

### Upcoming Online Petitions & Event Log
##
***Note:*** no action stated in below petitions will replace the irrevocable demands and terms set by Alghuti (will be published in file 9 of 9). If it is found that the conduct of attorney‚Äôs, judges, officers, and other officials (elected by interests) involved in this case are considered "legal", it is evidence of an illegitimate legal system, and it is a duty to abolish it entirely.  

* Petition for the immediate removal of Kerri Foley and all judges involved in this case from the bench, and to bar named judges from any public office or position of trust. The procedure used in this case, as well as actions taken by attorney‚Äôs, judges, other officers involved has discredited the judiciary or the administration of justice. This [Commission](http://www.scjc.texas.gov/faq/) has been aware of these practices, and has done nothing. 

* Demand the Harris Administration identity who the victim is in this case, in reference to the [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), Which states - <i>"For too long, domestic violence was considered a ‚Äúfamily issue‚Äù and was left for families to address in private."</i> <strong><i>"many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family"</i></strong>.. ü§î sounds about right. 
***Note*** to achieve the 100,000 signature required to get this to the Whitehouse, a video will be produced for conveying to the general public. 

* Recently Twitter blocked me from the account established for this page before I had the chance to make a single post. If the FTC fails to enforce antitrust policy within 90 days, a call for protest and demand for the immediate seizure all the company assets will be published. In the mean time im looking into viable alternatives such as Vkontakte or odnoklassniki. It is sad that we now have to rely on foreign social media platforms to communicate. That's the United State's of America in the year 2022, with "freedom of the press" as the only profession explicitly mentioned in the constitution by name.

### Disclaimer 
A significant portion of this project aims to extend certain legal immunity to persons (in any jurisdiction) working on a project which uses Criterion protocol (refer to whitepaper - Document 5 of 9). 
Because we are still in the early stages of this development, readers should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project-based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law.

## Introduction to Guilty Until Proven Otherwise - Practices of the Galveston County Court (File 2 of 9)

Methods and Questions Used in Preliminary Findings 

Did police have enough evidence to arrest and charge Hatem Al-Ghuti with ‚Äòmaking a terroristic threat against a family member‚Äô on 12/23/20,  based on verbal statements made by Lisa Salazar, Samia Marmash, and Rawan Al-Najjar.

Note: At this stage police did not ask Hatem Alghuti for a statement, and arrested Hatem Alghuti around 8:15 PM on 12/23/20 based on verbal statements made by Lisa Salazar, Samia Marmash, and Rawan Al-Najjar. The arrest occurred prior to taking Edward Salazar‚Äôs statement, and prior to the written statements attached as Exhibit-3 through Exhibit-6 in File# 1 of 9. 

Did the county have enough evidence to charge Hatem Al-Ghuti with ‚Äòmaking a terroristic threat against a family member‚Äô on 12/23/20, based on the four written testimonies recorded in the police report?

Note: based on the four written testimonies recorded in the police report, three out of four statements have a general consensus of the event, while one statement introduces an entirely new narrative which suggests (a) the neighbor (making the allegation) was informed the suspect had a weapon,  aware he is a violent extremist,  and decided to ‚Äúsee the situation ‚Äú rather than calling the police; (b) Hatem made a Terroristic Threat. 

Assuming Jack Roady answered ‚ÄòYes‚Äô to the above argument‚Äôs, it would only be a logical conclusion that the presumed compelling evidence used in to arrest and charge Hatem Al-Ghuti (for ‚Äúmaking a terroristic threat‚Äù) must also be used to prosecute the criminal case. Instead, Jack Roady relies on a statement (which contradicts the initial statement) filed after Hatem Alghuti was arrested and later charged.

On [February 1, 2021] Jack Roady signed [this letter](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/604383361e7814de3826ec060cc8d9788f00a54d/Roady_1.jpeg). In support of the allegations made in this letter, Jack Roady relies on an affidavit filed on 12/29/20 (by Matthew Skillern), almost a week after the ‚Äòterroristic threat‚Äô charge had already been issued by the county‚Äî after arresting Hatem Al-Ghuti without charge. The charges issued prior to 12/29/20 are based on statements filed by Rawan on 12/23/20, where no reference of a threat to ‚Äúkill‚Äù is made.

The strategy used by Jack Roady to undermine the religious office which has been misrepresented in Rawan Issa Alnajjar‚Äôs affidavit has already been addressed [below section 4(a)[in response](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/001e9e2ddb3c3005b6d121bf8f073523dfc571da/21-FD-0102%20-%20Response.pdf)] to Matthew Allen Skillern‚Äôs petition, denying the court any jurisdiction over the subject matter and person of the office.

Conclusion, there is no separation whatsoever between the civil and criminal case. The statement used by Jack Roady is derived from the affidavit filed for the exclusive purpose of gaining advantage in a divorce and undermining the religious office (see response)

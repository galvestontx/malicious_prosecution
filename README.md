***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, that practice an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these [statements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk), which some may find offensive. I decided to make information public to prevent the same from happening to other's. So long as no one knows what is taking place at Galveston County and elsewhere, and the public rely solely on the falsified information published in court records, nothing will prevent these criminals from engaging in the same harmful activity.  

Note: the false testimony of named persons in the above [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-7dWshR_VGjhiRWMwYHnGV6fxh7-knF/view?usp=drivesdk) is of little concern (as it is expected), my primary concern is the government response. 
I do not accept anyone punishing my former wife for false testimony. This case is testimony to why the Quran requires two men as witness, and if you cannot find two men, then one man and two women. In this case, you have one woman submitting two separate statements that contradict one another, and two women who submitted one statement, neither of which align with one another. The mathematical conclusion? You cannot act on the testimony of one woman... the evidence speaks for itself. 

We have people running the state who convinced themselves that it is okay to interfere in the private affairs of a family-by framing one party with a crime, in order to strip the person of any right, and enforce an illegally eviction. Im certain these people will be punished according to their involvement, there is no escape, nor will any immunity be granted. Such justice is not possible in Texas court's...made clear by this case. It is time people come to peace with this fact...you/we are now required to protect ourselves from the government pretending to represent us. The sooner you accept this fact, the faster we can get past this dark chapter in our history.

### Malicious Prosecution

***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense.  These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 



> According to Galveston County District Attorney‚Äôs official website, Jack Roady ‚Äúserves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County‚Äù.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney)

> The official website further states ‚ÄúThe primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done‚Äù. Let's take a look at Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

### Upcoming Online Petitions & Event Log
***Note:*** no action stated in below petitions will replace the irrevocable demands and terms set by Alghuti (will be published in file 9 of 9). If it is found that the conduct of attorney‚Äôs, judges, officers, and other officials (elected by interests) involved in this case are considered "legal", it is evidence of an illegitimate legal system, and it is a duty to abolish it entirely.  

* Recently Twitter blocked me from the account established for this page before I had the chance to make a single post. If the FTC fails to enforce antitrust policy within 90 days, a call for protest and demand for the immediate seizure all the company assets will be published. In the mean time im looking into viable alternatives such as Vkontakte or odnoklassniki. It is sad that we now have to rely on foreign social media platforms to communicate. That's the United State's of America in the year 2022, with "freedom of the press" as the only profession explicitly mentioned in the constitution by name.

* Petition for the immediate removal of Kerri Foley and all judges involved in this case from the bench, and to bar named judges from any public office or position of trust. The procedure used in this case, as well as actions taken by attorney‚Äôs, judges, other officers involved has discredited the judiciary or the administration of justice. This [Commission](http://www.scjc.texas.gov/faq/) has been aware of these practices, and has done nothing. 

* Demand the Harris Administration identity who the victim is in this case, in reference to this [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), Which states - <i>"For too long, domestic violence was considered a ‚Äúfamily issue‚Äù and was left for families to address in private."</i> <strong><i>"many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family"</i></strong>.. ü§î sounds about right.
***Note*** to achieve the 100,000 signature required to get this to the Whitehouse, a video will be produced for conveying to the general public. 

### Disclaimer 
A significant portion of this project aims to extend certain legal immunity to persons (in any jurisdiction) working on a project which uses Criterion protocol (refer to whitepaper - Document 5 of 9). 
Because we are still in the early stages of this development, readers should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project-based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law.

***DECLARATION***

I, Hatem T. Alghuti, declare Texas courts illegitimate, and unconstitutional institutions, that practice an unknown law, and provide the [following](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6vn3HHm6z-dXNBUNmM8QrHjJHQ0nHx1/view?usp=drivesdk) evidence in support of this declaration. I invite the public to attend the trials to take place at Galveston County, to witness first hand the illegal enforcement of the unknown law. I further call for the dissolution of the declared illegal institutions.

***Warning:*** please be advised foul language is used in these [statements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6vn3HHm6z-dXNBUNmM8QrHjJHQ0nHx1/view?usp=drivesdk), which some may find offensive...myself included. I decided to make information public to prevent the same from happening to other's. So long as no one knows what is taking place at Galveston County and elsewhere, and the public rely solely on the falsified information published in court records, nothing will prevent these criminals from engaging in the same harmful activity.

> ***[File - 1 of 9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcSdHEEKjGkIfb6JfCF1ofDCBqTJeDtI/view?usp=drivesdk)*** has been uploaded...after the eight remaining files are uploaded, ***Galvestontx.co*** will begin development of a ***DApp*** to supplant the county and state governments within two years, and invite everyone to join. See training material below Roll-Out Schedule. Please note, this ***GalvestonTx Page*** and ***GalvestonTx.co*** website is ***NOT*** affiliated in anyway with the government of Galveston County…as it is known. 


***FILES 1 THROUGH 9***
* All evidence supporting the summary in ***File 1 of 9*** is attached therein as ***Exhibit A*** through ***10B*** - including the police statements, which are attached as ***Exhibit 3-6***. The [audio](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/cee3feb0e13e67209791023ee602ef2bd3e9ee39/First_Call.m4a) of the Emergency Call Transcription (Exhibit-A transcription) is now available for download. 

* ***File 2 of 9*** supplements the first file, and includes evidence the court already convicted Alghuti of a crime prior to the first setting scheduled on May 6, 2022. This is the result of deliberately intermingling the civil case with the criminal charges. 

* ***New Development*** : ***File 3 of 9*** Analyzes the reason Hatem Alghuti was arrested on May 6 2022 (for the third time) and held for almost a week at the county concentration camp. Hatem Alghuti refused food while he was detained, and suffered as a result of this third wave of county terror. Alghuti, still unaware why he was arrested inside of the courtroom on 5/6/22, in what was supposed to be the first setting for the case enumerated in file 1 of 9, is now seeking for the court to explain the motives behind such belligerent actions. These events come as a surprise to many of Hatem's peers, now questioning the court's persistent harassment and attacks against a person known for his shy, polite, and non confrontational personality. 
### Radical Extremist Infiltration of The Justice System - Posing As Advocates
* The actions stated below 'New Development' occurred after file-1 of 9 had been reviewed by assistant DA Kimberly Bronson Kimberly.Bronson@galvestoncountytx .gov, with proof Lisa Salazar committed purjury. The email requested that the case be dismissed. Instead, the court sought to introduce a new unrelated item to the case, to add Lisa Salazar to the protective order, although no communication existed between Alghuti and Lisa, nor was any threat made. The lastest arrest occurred 476 days after the events detailed in File 1of9. Alghuti inquired about the court's actions, and was informed "woman advocates" or "radical feminist" are behind these extreme acts of oppression. It is worth mentioning the common denominator between Kerri Foley and Jack Roady is that both individuals accepted campaign contributions from the ["Republican Women PAC"](https://www.transparencyusa.org/tx/payee/kerri-foley-campaign?cycle=2018-election-cycle). 
* At this stage, I do not recognize the legitimacy of this rogue court. The events described in File- 1of9 occurred within the confines of Alghuti's residence, and a copy of His Household's Code of Laws has been conveyed to the court. Religious Code shall supersede any and all immoral, unconstitutional, oppressive man made laws advocated by radical feminists or other deviant philosophies propagated by ***Edward Bernays***, the man credited for establishing the feminist movement <i> "in order to persuade women to smoke"</i> [10:28](https://youtu.be/DnPmg0R1M04). It would be unimaginable, that such extremist's, who ***Edward Bernays*** referred to as "stupid people" (although he established the movement) would hold any position in a court of Justice.
* To justify the court's jurisdiction, the judge asked Hatem Alghuti if he is a citizen of the United States (as though their acts are constitutional). Under Religious precepts, Alghuti is authorized to conceal the truth (to divert the aggressor) if his household is attacked, if he is threatened, coerced, or has reason to believe his life is in danger (in this case starvation as a result of hunger strike). In emergency situations, He is permitted to engage in certain acts which otherwise would be prohibited. Emergency powers are activated if certain hostilities are committed against him, or an act of war is committed against the faithful, the innocent, or those who cannot defend themselves against armed oppressors'. A letter condemning persons engaged in purjury and the state court (for harassment) has also been filed.

* ***File 3 of 9*** waiting for Court Papers...

* This case will be used in marketing material to show how the state courts aim to break up families... all faith traditions are against these policies. Phase one, Record Keeping System for Marriage Certificates, Birth certificates, property deeds. ***Currently Compiling List of Churches***, will reach out to these [1,080 Islamic Center's](https://github.com/galvestontx/malicious_prosecution/blob/5b33eeb149fcb2af408f1f26f0525b3472234a8c/1080_CallList.csv) after the completion of the first phase.
* Analyze cases on this [page](https://m.facebook.com/BustedNewspaperGalvestonCountyTx/) lets see what we can dig up. The objective is to organize information and other resources for organizations to investigate/ sue the county. Feel free to forward this link to media outlets.
* Will reach out to attorney's to see if they would consider filing a class action lawsuit against the Galveston County for allowing third party private companies to [publish mugshots on Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/BustedNewspaperGalvestonCountyTx/). Texas is [suing Facebook for capturing and using the biometric data](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-sues-facebook-using-unauthorized-biometric-data) without properly obtaining their informed consent to do so.

# THE COUNTY OF LEAGUED CITIES

***"We the People of the United States of North America, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty and property to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish The County of Leagued Cities."***

```

***Note*** the governance of this institution is embedded with no intermediary, to be gifted directly to the people it has been established to serve. Those who accept are welcome, those that reject are free to do so, and may continue to live under whatever structure they deem appropriate. There is no coercion, if such a structure is not more beneficial than what is available, It is encouraged to leave it for whatever serves them better. The Government of Galveston County, and by extension... the Government of the State of Texas, and the United States have made it clear to me they have nothing but destruction and decadence to offer. 
* Petition to Annex cities located within ****Precinct 1***, ***Precinct 3***, and ***Precinct 4***, as a county separate from Galveston County is scheduled to be uploaded by June 2022 (expect a slight delay due to Alghuti's recent release). This local intervention is in response to the corruption taking place at Galveston County... which has become grossly overbearing.
* Petition to rename the Galveston Causeway — ***Alghuti Toll Road***. Fee's collected will be used to pay restitution to Hatem Alghuti and the thousands of victims who have yet to be heard. Alternatively, close the bridge and convert Galveston into a prison island (officially) similar to Alcatraz Island. For many, Galveston is already considered a prison Island (population > 50,000 est) the county has about 19,000 jail admissions per year). 1 out of every 32 people on the island are in prison... Why not just arrest the remaining population and promote it as a New tourist attraction?
* We will be reaching out to respective commissioner's in the coming weeks.

### 2. Invite Family & Friends to Discuss the History of Galveston County 
> Invite Survivors of the Galveston County Concentration Camps to Speak at your Schools about the importance of 'Denazifying' our Communities (invitation should be every year, the week of June 19th).
##
A fifteen-month investigation of Galveston County revealed that thousands of people are locked away each year, without a hearing, simply because they cannot afford to pay money bail. The practice perpetuates a two-tiered and unconstitutional wealth-based incarceration system that devastates individuals, their families and their communities. Those who cannot afford bail must remain in jail for considerable periods of time, leading many to lose their jobs, their homes, and their children. As a result, defendants often plead guilty to the crimes of which they are charged, not because they are guilty, but because it’s the fastest way out of jail, and they are desperate to return to their communities.

***Facts:*** Galveston County has a history of criminalizing poverty. The documents on this page is evidence of the latest acts of terror the Galveston County Government has waged against persons that do not have access to the financial system, thus cannot hire defense.  These acts are inflicted upon tens of thousands of people every year in Galveston County alone. 

> According to Galveston County District Attorney’s official website, Jack Roady “serves alongside a team of 41 assistant district attorneys, 6 peace officers, and 25 support staff, who together prosecute more than 10,000 misdemeanor and felony cases each year in Galveston County”.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney)

> The official website further states “The primary duty of the prosecutor is not to convict, but to see that justice is done”. Let's examine Jack Roady's definition of Justice.

[Official Webpage](https://www.galvestoncountytx.gov/our-county/district-attorney/district-attorney-s-office)

We now have individuals running the state that are convinced it is alright to interfere in the private affairs of a family, by framing one party with a crime in order to strip the person of any right and enforce an illegal eviction. Im certain these people will be punished according to their involvement. Such justice is not possible in Texas court's...made clear by this case. The false testimony submitted by persons named in the above [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6vn3HHm6z-dXNBUNmM8QrHjJHQ0nHx1/view?usp=drivesdk) is of little concern (as it is expected), my primary concern is the government response.

### 3. Sign & Share Upcoming Online Petitions
##
***Note:*** no action stated in below petitions will replace the irrevocable demands and terms set by Alghuti (will be published in file 9 of 9). If it is found that the conduct of attorney’s, judges, officers, and other officials (elected by interests) involved in this case are considered "legal", it is evidence of an illegitimate legal system, and it is a duty to abolish it entirely.  

* Petition for the Annexation of Area 1, 3, 4 into the COUNTY OF LEAGUED CITIES 
* Petition for the immediate removal of Kerri Foley and all judges involved in this case from the bench, and to bar named judges from any public office or position of trust. The procedure used in this case, as well as actions taken by attorney’s, judges, other officers involved has discredited the judiciary or the administration of justice. This [Commission](http://www.scjc.texas.gov/faq/) has been aware of these practices, and has done nothing. 

* Demand the Harris Administration identity who the victim is in this case, in reference to the [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/30/a-proclamation-on-national-domestic-violence-awareness-and-prevention-month-2021/), Which states - <i>"For too long, domestic violence was considered a “family issue” and was left for families to address in private."</i> <strong><i>"many of us were told that it would cause the disintegration of the family. That was the phrase used. It would cause the disintegration of the family"</i></strong>.. 🤔 sounds about right. 
***Note*** to achieve the 100,000 signature required to get this to the Whitehouse, a video will be produced for conveying to the general public. 

* Recently Twitter blocked me from the account established for this page before I had the chance to make a single post. If the FTC fails to enforce antitrust policy within 90 days, a call for protest and demand for the immediate seizure all the company assets will be published. In the mean time im looking into viable alternatives such as Vkontakte or odnoklassniki. It is sad that we now have to rely on foreign social media platforms to communicate. That's the United State's of America in the year 2022, with "freedom of the press" as the only profession explicitly mentioned in the constitution by name. Not to worry, we are in good hands, the Harris Administration established ["A government agency creating a “ministry of truth” to combat what it deems misinformation? And it’s going to fall under the leadership of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas?](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3472878-joe-bidens-ministry-of-truth/) What could possibly go wrong...Right?

<sup> ***Additional Information***: Hatem Al-Ghuti pledges to convey title to approximately 10,256 square feet (~.2355 acres) of land in League City to the County of Leagued Cities. Title to property had been transferred into a private trust on August 11, 2020 at 5:56 PM for the purpose of securing Alghuti's property from hostile entities. The code securing the title to the property is self executing, thus removing it from Alghuti's direct management. This code will be published after ***File 9 of 9*** is uploaded. The County of Leagued Cities Appraisal District values the property on the land at $367,590 (in-kind exchange) - est. $146.80 per square foot.</sup>
